## Background and Theoretical Framework
Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. It has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

This project aims to explore and implement different reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complex tasks. By studying and implementing state-of-the-art algorithms, we can gain insights into the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning and apply them to real-world problems.

By understanding the background and theoretical framework of reinforcement learning, we can better appreciate the algorithms and techniques used in this project and their significance in the field.

## Usage
## Code Structure and Explanation

The main components of the project are:

- `algorithms/`: This directory contains the implementation of various algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file. For example, the DQN algorithm is implemented in `dqn.py`.
- `abc_rl`: This module contains the abstracted classes of reinforcement learning elements.
- `agnets`: 
- `configs`:
- `doc`: 
- `environment`:
- `experience_replay`:
- `exploration`
- `models`:
- `test`:
- `utils`: This directory contains utility functions and classes that are used by the algorithms. This could include functions for data preprocessing, model evaluation, etc.
