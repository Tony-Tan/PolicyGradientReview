## Introduction
Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning project! This project focuses on exploring and implementing different reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complex tasks. By studying and implementing state-of-the-art algorithms, we aim to gain insights into the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning and apply them to real-world problems.

In this project, we provide step-by-step installation instructions to help you set up the project and its dependencies. Once installed, you can explore the code structure, which includes different algorithms implemented in separate Python files under the `algorithms/` directory.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding new algorithms, improving existing code, or providing bug fixes. Check out the "Contributing" section for more information on how to contribute.

Now, let's get started with the installation and exploration of this Reinforcement Learning project!

## Background and Theoretical Framework
Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. It has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

This project aims to explore and implement different reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complex tasks. By studying and implementing state-of-the-art algorithms, we can gain insights into the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning and apply them to real-world problems.

By understanding the background and theoretical framework of reinforcement learning, we can better appreciate the algorithms and techniques used in this project and their significance in the field.
